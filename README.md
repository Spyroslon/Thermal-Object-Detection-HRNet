# Thermal Object Detection with High-Resolution Networks

*MSc Dissertation Project*

This project investigates the effectiveness of High-Resolution Networks (HRNet) for object detection in thermal imagery, comparing performance against traditional ResNet backbones. Using the MMDetection framework, Faster R-CNN models with different HRNet configurations were trained and evaluated on the FLIR ADAS thermal dataset.

The research demonstrates that HRNet backbones can significantly improve thermal object detection performance, with the HRNet-W40 configuration achieving a 7% improvement over the baseline ResNet-50-FPN backbone.
